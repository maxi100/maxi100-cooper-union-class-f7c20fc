A large amount of information circulates the Twitter database- 1.6 billion queries to be approxiamate, 
and a vast array of images are uploaded onto Piniterest too. I want to combine concepts from both websites to create a small resource pool for New Yorkers or anybody interested to see what New Yorkers are pinning and repinning via Twitter. The website is geared more toward photographers who are looking for specific type of images, but in the realms of Art, Fashion, Food, and Photography.
