A large amount of information circulates the Twitter database- 1.6 billion queries to be approxiamate; 
and a vast array of images are uploaded onto Piniterest's image collection like-wise.Pininterest in particular can be a wonderful source of inspiration for artists and those in an industry/doing something that may require them to amass certain material from a variety of individuals. You can also get a sense of what is going on in the city, for instance during Fashion week there was a stream of images from Runway shows, and Fashion Night out.I want my project to be a small, very particular resource pool for New Yorkers or anybody interested to see what New Yorkers are are pinning and repinning/New york-related material which is being put up on a daily basis. (The website could be geared more toward photographers who are looking for specific type of images),in the realms of Art, Fashion, Food, and Photography- it is in these catagories that I want the images/tweets to organiize themselves into. I am still uncertain how to add another dimentsion to the site which will differienciate it from a mere search that can easily be done on Twitter or Pininterest seperately.
